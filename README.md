# Neighbourhood-Map
This Neighbourhood Map project is used to build an app that displays famous in                                             
Delhi, and displays relevant Wikipedia articles about the location, if they exist.
 ### API key:                                                                               
 Authentication is the way towards proving your identity to someone.                                                            
 A typical method for doing that is through passwords which we are all mindful of.                                              
 However, often we have to validate programmatically for convenience's sake. That's the reason we used API Key.
##### What I used to build this project
1)Google Maps API                                                                       
2)Wikipedia API                                                                                           
3)KnockoutJS                                                                                            
4)HTML and CSS                                                            
######Requirements:                                         
Display map markers identifying at least 5 locations that you are interested in within chosen neighborhood.
Your app displays those locations by default when the page is loaded.
Implement a list view of the set of locations.
Provide a filter option that uses an input field to filter both the list view and the map markers displayed by default on load.
The list view and the markers update accordingly.
Add functionality using third-party APIs to provide information when a map marker or list view entry is clicked.
If we load the page we observerd that the icons are bounced and after seaching the place will be highlated.
